            <h4>web development as an industry</h4>
             <p> Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by 
                web development include e-commerce. Online auction sites such as eBay have
                changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and services. Online retailers
                such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many others) have transformed the shopping
                and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers. </p></div>

          <h4>practical web development</h4><p>
          Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing 
            industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing 
            to use their website to advertise and sell products and services to customers.</p>


              <p>There are many open source tools for web development such as BerkeleyDB, 
              GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has 
              kept the cost of learning web development to a minimum. Another contributing 
              factor to the growth of the industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG
               web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft
                Visual Studio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming
                 languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can be 
                 learned and implemented quickly.</p>
              
              <p>An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more 
              dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver 
              applications as web services which were traditionally only available as
               applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportunities 
               to decentralize information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with
                the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google 
                Drive. These web services allow users to interact with applications from many
                 locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their 
                 application environment.</p></div>
